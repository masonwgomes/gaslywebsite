          <h1>Pierre Gasly</h1>
          <p>
            <br>
            <h2>Early Life</h2>
            Pierre Jean-Jacques Gasly was born in Rouen, France to his father Jean-Jacques Gasly and mother Pascale. 
            He has four half brothers from both of his parent’s past relationships. His family has been involved in motorsports, 
            starting with his Grandfather and Grandmother competing in karting, and his father competing in Karting, Endurance Racing, 
            and rallying. As Gasly was growing up, his close friends in racing were Anthoine Hubert, Charles Leclerc, and his current 
            F1 teammate Esteban Ocon, who all fought against one another in karting.
            <br>
            <br>
            <h2>Karting and Early Racing</h2>
            Gasly entered karting at the age of ten in the year 2006. He participated in French Minime Championship for two years and 
            placed 15th and then 4th. Moving on up, he competed in the French Cadet Championship before moving into the KF3 catergory 
            until 2010 which was international, which he finished as runner-up. Like other F1 drivers, he took part in Formula Renault, 
            his debut in single seater racing. After jumping around to different competitions and landing podiums and wins, he moved to 
            the big games
            <br>
            <br>
            <h2>Beginning F1</h2>
            After proving himself in the lower categories, his time finally arrived and joined Toro Rosso, RedBull’s F1 B-Team in 2017.
            During his time at Toro Rosso, he consistantly outperformed his teammates and got attention of the RedBull team. As the 2018 
            season ended, he beat his teammate 29 to 4 points.
            <br>
            <br>
            <h2>Moving on up to RedBull</h2>
            Starting the 2019 season, Gasly was promoted to RedBull, partnering Max Verstappen. Despite being in the better car, Gasly 
            was not delivering what RedBull wanted of him and demoted him midseason which is very rare. Ahead of the 2019 Belgian GP, 
            RedBull demoted Gasly back to Toro Rosso without warning, being replaced by Alex Albon. That same weekend, his close friend 
            Anthoine Hubert was participating in F2 when he had a fatal crash.
            <br>
            <br>
            <h2>AlphaTauri domination</h2>
            Hubert’s last words to Gasly was about his demotion to Toro Rosso, saying to Gasly; “Prove everyone wrong, and show them 
            your skills and talent.” That is exactly what Gasly did. During his time at AlphaTauri (formally Toro Rosso), he dominated.
            During the 2020 Monza GP, the stars aligned for Gasly, a chance to finally show what he was made of. After a fortunate series 
            of events, Gasly was leading the GP, only needing to hold off former teammate Carlos Sainz for the win, which he did. After 
            this win, Gasly was consistantly dominating the midfield in this car and was ready to move up to Redbull again, but long term 
            contracts for both Max Verstappen and Sergio Perez prevented another promotion.
            <br>
            <br>
            <h2>A new chapter at Alpine</h2>
            From a racer’s perspective, they always want to be competeing at the front, but AlphaTauri was not the place for that. Since 
            there was nowhere to go within the RedBull family besides dominating in a B-Team car, he decided to leave the RedBull family. 
            Gasly joined the french BWT Alpine F1 Team along side his old french teammate Esteban Ocon. During the first race of the 2023 
            season, Gasly qualified last because of track limits and poor tires at a bad time. Despite being placed at the back of the grid, 
            Gasly finished the race P9, showing that he isn’t done yet.
