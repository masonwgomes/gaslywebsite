            During the Italian Grand Prix at the Monza International Circuit 
            during the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic, Pierre Gasly qualified 
            in the middle of the field at P10, but who knew what would come next.
            Because of 2 safety cars for Kevin Magnussen and Charles LeClerc, 
            Gasly gained 7 position to P2, only behind Lewis Hamilton because 
            he already pit for tires before the saftey car came out. This allowed
            him to pass a large portion of the grid because they were in the pitlane
            On lap 35, Gasly was in first with only Carlos Sainz 5 seconds behind. 
            The gap would slowly decrease, but all Gasly had to do was defend. 
            After 18 laps of defending and pulling away, Gasly won at Monza.

          After nailing his Q3 lap at the Baku City Circuit, Gasly landed P4 to start 
          at Azerbaijan. Since Baku is a street circuit, qualifying is everything because 
          it is difficult to overtake. Throughout the race, there were double yellow flags and a 
          safety car, Gasly managed to maintain and gain positions. Verstappen and Stroll 
          DNF'd with tyre failure, Russell with a gearbox issue, and his future teammate 
          Ocon retiring due to his turbocharger, Gasly managed to get his third and latest 
          F1 podium to this day.
